## BUSINESS POSTURE

**Business Priorities and Goals:**
- Provide automated software architecture analysis and documentation generation
- Enable developers to create comprehensive C4 model diagrams and design documents
- Support multiple AI backends (Cursor Agent, Fabric) for flexible architecture analysis
- Streamline the process of maintaining up-to-date system documentation
- Reduce manual effort in creating and updating architectural diagrams

**Key Business Risks:**
- Risk of outdated or inaccurate architectural documentation leading to poor system understanding
- Risk of inconsistent documentation standards across development teams
- Risk of manual documentation processes becoming bottlenecks in development cycles
- Risk of architectural debt accumulation due to lack of systematic analysis

## SECURITY POSTURE

**Existing Security Controls:**
- security control: Pre-commit hooks configured for code quality and security checks
- security control: Dependabot configured for automated dependency vulnerability scanning
- security control: CI/CD pipeline with automated testing and validation
- security control: Python package isolation through virtual environments
- security control: Git-based version control with branch protection

**Accepted Risks:**
- accepted risk: Command-line tool execution requires appropriate system permissions
- accepted risk: AI backend integrations may process sensitive codebase information
- accepted risk: Generated documentation may contain system architecture details

**Recommended Security Controls:**
- security control: Implement input validation and sanitization for all user inputs
- security control: Add authentication and authorization for AI backend integrations
- security control: Implement secure configuration management for API keys and credentials
- security control: Add audit logging for all architecture analysis operations
- security control: Implement rate limiting for AI backend API calls
- security control: Add encryption for sensitive configuration data

**Security Requirements:**
- Secure handling of codebase analysis data
- Protection of AI backend API credentials
- Secure file system access for codebase scanning
- Input validation for all command-line arguments
- Secure communication with external AI services
